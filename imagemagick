To make thumbnails of all the JPGs in a directory with a width of 100 pixels:
Code:

cd /path/to/image_directory
for i in $(ls *.jpg); do convert -scale 100 $i th-$i; done



Fill Area Flag ('^' flag)

As of IM v6.3.8-3 IM now has a new geometry option flag '^' which is used to
resize the image based on the smallest fitting dimension. That is, the image is
resized to completely fill (and even overflow) the pixel area given.


  convert dragon.gif    -resize 64x64^  fill_dragon.gif
  convert terminal.gif  -resize 64x64^  fill_terminal.gif

[IM Output] ==> [IM Output] [IM Output] ==> [IM Output]

As it stands this option does not seem very useful, but when combined with
either a centered (or uncentered) "-crop" or "-extent" to remove the excess
parts of the image, you can fit the image so as to completely fill the area
specified. Both the resize and the final image size arguments should be the
same values.

Though the "-crop" is most logical, it may require an extra "+repage" to remove
virtual canvas layering information. The "-extent" does not require this
cleanup, but still allows the use of "-gravity" for positioning. See Cutting
and Bordering for more information.


  convert dragon.gif      -resize 64x64^ \
          -gravity center -extent 64x64  fill_crop_dragon.gif
  convert terminal.gif    -resize 64x64^ \
          -gravity center -extent 64x64  fill_crop_terminal.gif
