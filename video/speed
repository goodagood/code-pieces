Speeding up/slowing down video

You can change the speed of a video stream using the setpts video filter.
Note that in the following examples, the audio stream is not changed, so it
should ideally be disabled with -an.

To double the speed of the video, you can use:

    ffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter:v "setpts=0.5*PTS" output.mkv

The filter works by changing the presentation timestamp (PTS) of each video
frame. For example, if there are two succesive frames shown at timestamps 1 and
2, and you want to speed up the video, those timestamps need to become 0.5 and
1, respectively. Thus, we have to multiply them by 0.5.

Note that this method will drop frames to achieve the desired speed. You can
avoid dropped frames by specifying a higher output frame rate than the input.
For example, to go from an input of 4 FPS to one that is sped up to 4x that (16
FPS):

    ffmpeg -i input.mkv -r 16 -filter:v "setpts=0.25*PTS" output.mkv

To slow down your video, you have to use a multiplier greater than 1:

    ffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter:v "setpts=2.0*PTS" output.mkv
