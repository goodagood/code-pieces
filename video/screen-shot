You can use import tool available in the ImageMagick package (you need to install this if its already not available on your system).

Run the following command in a shell:

import screenshot.png

and select the window you want to capture or select a region by pressing the left mouse button and dragging.

import is a actually a very powerful command which can be used in many ways to > capture the screen. For example, to capture the entire screen and after some delay and resizing it, use the following command:

import -window root -resize 400×300 -delay 200 screenshot.png

To see all the options available with import command, go to ImageMagick’s website.

Source and more info.

Another way to take a screenshot from the terminal is with scrot

To install scrot type:

sudo apt-get install scrot

To take a screenshot in Linux from the terminal with scrot type:

scrot MyScreenshot.png

Some more options with scrot are here:

scrot -b -d 5 '%Y:%m:%d:%H:%M:%S.png' -e 'mv $f ~/Desktop/'

In this example,

-b specifies including the window borders
-d specifies a delay of five seconds
'%Y:%m:%d:%H:%M:%S.png' will save the screenshot with a name based on the current date and time and with the format specified, .png in this case
-e 'mv $f ~/Desktop/' tells scrot to save the screenshot to the Desktop
