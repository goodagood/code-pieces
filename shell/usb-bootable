7. Using the terminal (in my opinion the best 100% of the way)

As is known, the terminal is installed in any Linux distribution by default, so
install additional software is not required.

The terminal command to write the iso image, the distribution is as follows:

sudo dd if=/home/USER/linuxmint.iso of=/dev/sdb

Where instead of /home/USER/linuxmint.iso you need to specify the path to the
iso file. sdb in the end, it's a stick on which is written the way. 

Note about DD utility


To determine your flash drive, run in terminal:

 df

Make a bootable flash drive from an ISO image on Linux Mint using terminal

And if you stick decided differently, change in the command.

To be entered correctly in the command path to the file, open the folder with
the file, open next to the terminal and drag the file into the terminal:


Now we are ready to start. I got the command:

 sudo dd if=/home/linuxmintpro/Downloads/linuxmint-17.1-mate-64bit-LinuxMint.Pro-edition.iso of=/dev/sdb1

The cursor of the terminal is blinking and it seems that nothing happens, but
actually being recorded. Wait for the image capture and at the end you should
see in the terminal like this:

That's all

Good Luck!!!
