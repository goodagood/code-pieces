China history in 7 minutes

China became the 2nd largest economy, how it becomes in long
history?

It's 3500years ago, about 1500 BC, when ancient Chinese people invented
Chinese writtings,
Some teachers would put the Chinese history a few
thousands years before the date, it's not a big difference
when people found bone millions years old.

In China Shang and Zhou was the 2 dynasties got degree of writing
history. Then it followed by long seasons of spring and autum, war
states kept fighting each other, then there was the first
emperor of dynasty Qin.

The 1st emperor Qin set up strong central ruling
system for Chinese, It's a system like a pyramid
of power, but when Egyptians had already given up pyramid building.

After dynasty of Qin, there were similar dynasties of
central power system, they were Han, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan,
Ming, Qing. One follow the before. 

they castrate men and use them as servants, 1k years ago, from dynasty Song, 
they start breaking women's feet physically in young age,
and call it a culture.

So china history is different from the west, it's an huge pyramid of power, 
it has no renaissance and age of discovery,
until Europeans find the big eastern kingdom.

it was during the dynasty of Qing,
British won the war of opium in 1842, Qing
start to collapse from then on, and Chinese turn into such
helpless condition. 

If we recall some events between China and USA,
in 1882 USA past Chinses Exclusion Act, 
In 1908 USA Congress passed a bill and president
Theodore Roosevelt started the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship
program.

Qing ended in 1911 

history before it looks like it went through from Qin to Qing.

chinese communist party (ccp) get hands on China from 1949,

immedially, they start to kill land-owners and their
families, by millions. 

Chinese and Americans fought during the Korean War, but Chinese solider denied
they were send by China government, they had to call themself
volunteers.

After the war, communists turned inside to kill over 30 million Chinese by
starvation from 1959-61.  

I know you can't believe it, I don't want to believe it too.

Then they tested nuclear weapon in Oct. 1964, 
then, Mao and his comrades start to torture more Chinese by
another political revolution, it's been called The Great Culture Revolution.

Those dead was not killed by executions but by their families
and friends, they were forced to do it in political
oppressions.

In the same time, USA went to land on the Moon in 1969, 
Steve Jobs start to sell Apple computers in 1976

then, ccp start to use markets, it's
been called reforming and opening, it's market but not a free market. 

1989, there was killings in Tian-An-Men square, Beijin,  in
the same year German people broke down the Berlin wall.

1999 they start persecutions and mass torturing of Fa-Lun-Gong practioners.

Then people learnt the business of human organ transplant.

2001 China joined WTO, it exports more and more products
made in labor intensive factories, no one call it slave
factory.

In the same time, they hold on birth control policies,
Some people think it's just pregnant abortion but
how they did it? push women onto the table and pull the flesh
out of their body. 

But the market and trading brought China to the position of
2nd economic volume, 

The ccp  become a huge group benefitting from
the history of killing and torturing, they get over 100M member
with them and commanding power facing the world.

How they keep the benefits? they split Internet into 2 parts, one is the old
Internet, one is China Internet.

They twisted the history and brain-wash
people in time of 4g/5G communication, yes, free speech is not without
costs, but how much should Chinese pay for it? by death
toll?
